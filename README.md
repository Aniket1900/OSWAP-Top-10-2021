  2.<b>A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures:</b> 
  This includes security failures when data is in transit or at rest, such as the implementation of weak cryptographic algorithms, poor or lax key generation, a failure to        implement encryption or to verify certificates, and the transmission of data in cleartext.
