# OSWAP-Top-10-2021
The Open Web Application Security Project top ten list 2021.
<br> Hi, I will be listing top 10 vulnerabilities in year 2021 and a breif description on them. 
Consider this as notes for self studying and may not necessarily be my own content.<br>

<br>1.<u><b>A01:2021-Broken Access Control: </b></u><br>
  Access control vulnerabilities include privilege escalation, malicious URL modification, access control bypass, CORS misconfiguration, and tampering with primary keys <br>
<br>2.<u><b>A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures:</b></u> 
  This includes security failures when data is in transit or at rest, such as the implementation of weak cryptographic algorithms, poor or lax key generation, a failure to         implement encryption or to verify certificates, and the transmission of data in cleartext.<br>
<br>3.<u><b>A03:2021-Injection:</b></u>
  Common injections impact SQL,NoSQL, OS command, and LDAP, and may be caused by sanitization failures, XSS vulunerabilities, and a lack of protection for file paths.<br> 
<br>4.<u><b>A04:2021-Insecure Design: </b></u><br> 
  Insecure design elements vary widely, but are generally described by OWASP as "missing or ineffective control design". Area of concern include a lack of protection for stored   data, logic programming problems, and displaying content that reveals sensitive information.<br>
<br>5.<u><b>A05:2021- Security Misconfiguration: </b></u> <br> 
  Application may be considered vulnerable if they lack security hardening, if there are unneccessary features- such as a too-open hand when it comes to privileges - if deafult   accounts are kept active, and if security features are not configured correctly. <br> 
<br>6.<u><b>A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Componets:</b></u><br>
  This category focuses on client and server-side components, out-of-date support systems- such as an OS, web servers, or libraries -as well as component misconfiguration. <br>
<br>7.<u><b>A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failure: </b></u><br>
  Security issue include improper authentication, session fixation, cetificate mismatches, premiting weak credentials, and a lack of protection against brute-force attacks. <br>
<br>8.<u><b>A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failure: </b></u> <br> 
  Integrity is the focal point of this category, and any failure to do so properly - such as the deserilization of untrusted data, or not checking code and updates when pulled     from a remote source- may be in scope.<br>
<br>9.<u><b>A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failure:</b></u> <br> 
  Issues that can hamper the analysis of a data breach or other form of attacek, including logging problems, failing to record security-relevant information feeds, or only         logging data locally come under this category.<br> 
<br>10.<u><b>A10:2021-Server-Side- Request Forgery:</b></u> <br>
  SSRF vulnerabilities occur when a server does not validate user-submitted URLs when they fetch remote resources. OWASP says that the adoption of cloud service and increasingly   complex architectures have ramped up the severity of SSRF attacks<br>
